# Contact

If you have any questions about the software or if you encountered any issues when
using it, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. The project is in its early
phase so there may still be many undetected issues. 

In case you want to contribute to the project, feel free to work on any of the active
issues listed on the GitHub page, or to implement features that you would like to use in
your work or research. 

If the matter at hand is not urgent, we recommend that you open an issue on the GitHub 
page of the project in which you can describe your problem or inquiry. This would make it
easier to keep track of the bugs found and the requested features.

In case you are experiencing issues that require immediate attention, send an e-mail to
the developer at <f.stavarache@student.tue.nl>.
