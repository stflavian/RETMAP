A python tool for computing and predicting characteristic curves and isotherms from experimental and simulated data.
This project was developed during Flavian's Bachelor's End Project at Eindhoven University of Technology. 

This version of the code contains all the functionalities needed to complete the End Project, but it is **not** suitable
for general usage. The documentation is incomplete and some variables are hardcoded. This version only serves as proof 
of the work done.
